    <h2>Contents</h2>
    <h3>For the dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3,5 glasses of flour</li>
        <li>1 glass of warm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the mince</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250g of mince</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>Half a teaspoon of pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Add the eggs and water, mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Shred the onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain the juice and discard. </li>
        <li>Divide the dough into two portions and lightly flour a work surface. Keep one piece of dough covered while you roll out the second portion into a rectangle, rolling the dough as thin as you can.</li>
        <li>Place about 2 teaspoons of the meat filling in the center of each square. Seal the dumplings by gathering the edges of the dough and pinching them together at the top to form a bundle. </li>
        <li>Heat the oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just until the pepper flakes have started to color the oil; don't let them burn. </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook the manti until the filling is no longer pink, and the dough is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well. Divide the manti among four plates. </li>
    </ol>
