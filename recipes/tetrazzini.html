    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Delicious and creamy! This recipe is my brother's favorite of everything that I cook, and the first one I mastered.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>Half pound fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into strips</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons shredded Swiss cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 pinch dried thyme, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a casserole dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken strips in the hot oil until no longer pink, about 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Slowly mix chicken broth into vegetables, stirring to form a thick sauce; mix cream and milk into sauce. Simmer until thickened, about 1 minute. </li>
        <li>Spread half the cooked fettuccine pasta into bottom of prepared casserole dish, top with half the chicken and half the cream sauce. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese topping is nicely browned, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
